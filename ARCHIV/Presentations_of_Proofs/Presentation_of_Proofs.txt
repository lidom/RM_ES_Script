Presentation-Topics per groups:

1. Group "Instrumental Variables":
Lemma 3.1.1 (Orthogonal Projection matrices)
Proposition 3.1.2 (OLS residuals)
Proposition 3.1.3 (Variance decomposition) 
(Note: For Lemma 3.1.1 no proof is given in the script;
however, you need to present Lemma 3.1.1 (without proofs)
for the proofs of the Propositions. Of course, if you want
to present a proof for Lemma 3.1.1 you can do so.)


2. Group "Difference-in-Differences Estimation":
Proposition 3.1.4 (R^2 increase) + adjusted R^2
(introduction, motivation, explanation)


3. Group "Regression discontinuity design":
Proposition 3.1.5 (Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem)


4. Group "Random Forest for Classification Problems":
Theorem 4.1 (Finite Sample Properties)


5. Group "Bayesian Hierarchical Models":
Theorem 4.2 (Unbiasedness of s^2)
